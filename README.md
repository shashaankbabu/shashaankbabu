### Hello, world!

## I’m Shashaank — engineer, explorer, and lifelong learner.

I’m fascinated by the inner workings of systems—from software and algorithms to the broader philosophies shaping technology and business. My drive is to uncover how things operate beneath the surface, continuously seeking the “why” behind the “how.”

Currently, I’m building resilient platforms as a Cloud Developer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (GreenLake Cloud Platform). My journey has spanned startups, product engineering, and system design, all fueled by curiosity and a hands-on approach.

Outside code, you'll find me reflecting on the philosophy of life, business insights, or diving into an interesting read. I enjoy connecting with fellow explorers—if that’s you, let’s share and build together!
