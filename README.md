## About me
I'm fascinated by how systems work — from low-level infrastructure to distributed platforms. I enjoy building resilient cloud-native solutions, designing pragmatic observability, and turning complex problems into simple, reliable services.

- 🛠️ Primary focus: Cloud platforms, distributed systems, observability, and backend engineering.  
- 📚 Outside work: reading tech books, thinking about product & business, and motorcycle trips.
